If you have five apples, then count backwards three times, you can figure out how many are left after that fact, can you not? Five, four, three. The next number, two, is the result that we've been searching for. 

Is that a clear enough answer? Most can do math this simple without giving it a second thought. Really, you should make it a priority to get to that point within the next few minutes.

Here are a few problems to get you along your way:

If I have four cookies, and eat two of them, how many are left? The answer is two, which is what you should have deducated already.
If I have seven flies, then two die after I smash them against the wall, how many are left? The answer is five.
If there are nine toys, but then nine are stolen, how many do you have left to play with? The answer, of course, is none.
